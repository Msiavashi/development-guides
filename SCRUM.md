# Applied Scrum Methodology

## User Story Creation:

- The Product Owner is responsible for creating user stories in the Issue Tracker and assigning them to the Product Backlog.

- User stories should adhere to the INVEST criteria, ensuring they are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.

- Story point estimations should be limited to user stories and bugs, excluding tasks and sub-tasks.

## Sprint Planning:

- Prior to each sprint, the Product Owner should prioritize user stories in the Product Backlog.

- The Scrum Master and development team should estimate the effort required for each user story using story points.

- During sprint planning, the development team should commit to a specific set of user stories to be completed within the sprint.

## Sprint Execution:

- A daily stand-up meeting should be held by the development team to discuss progress, challenges, and daily plans.

- Developers must update their assigned tasks and report progress in the Issue Tracker on a daily basis.

- Developers can create sub-tasks within user stories.

- Any impediments hindering progress should be raised and addressed during the daily stand-up or promptly afterward.

- The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring adherence to Scrum principles and removing obstacles.

## Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective:

- At the end of each sprint, a review meeting should be conducted to present completed user stories to stakeholders.

- The development team should showcase implemented functionality using the Issue Tracker during the review.

- Following the sprint review, a retrospective meeting should occur to reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement.

- The retrospective findings should be documented in the Issue Tracker, and action items assigned and tracked for future sprints.

## Issue Tracker Usage:

- All tasks, sub-tasks, and user stories should be created and tracked in the Issue Tracker.

## Communication and Collaboration:

- Important discussions, decisions, and information should be documented in the Issue Tracker comments or relevant fields.

- Collaboration tools integrated with the Issue Tracker (Teams) can be utilized for detailed documentation, knowledge sharing, and team collaboration.

## Continuous Improvement:

- Regular review and refinement of Scrum processes and Issue Tracker usage should take place to identify areas for improvement.

## Product Owner Responsibility:

- The Product Owner is primarily responsible for creating user stories, working closely with stakeholders, gathering requirements, and prioritizing the Product Backlog.

- The Product Owner ensures that user stories focus on the value they provide and the problems they solve, testing and matching the delivery with corresponding stories.

## Collaborative Approach:

- Involving the development team in the user story creation process is beneficial.

- The development team can offer valuable input during backlog refinement sessions to clarify and refine user stories, fostering a shared understanding of requirements.

## Team Collaboration on Tasks and Subtasks:

- While the Product Owner is accountable for user stories, the development team can create tasks or subtasks to break them down into smaller, actionable items.

- Tasks and subtasks can be generated by any team member based on their expertise and understanding of the work involved.

- The development team should collaborate on defining and assigning tasks or subtasks during sprint planning or backlog refinement sessions.

## Unplanned Issues:

- Decisions to create new and unplanned issues or tasks should be made collaboratively with the Product Owner and Scrum Master, considering the impact on the sprint goal, team capacity, and ability to deliver planned work within the sprint timeframe.

### Examples of Unplanned Issues:

- **Emergent Work:** Critical or urgent work that arises during the sprint, such as immediate bug fixes or unforeseen tasks, can be created after approval from the Product Owner and Scrum Master.

- **Technical Debt:** Addressing technical debt or critical codebase issues affecting the sprint goal may necessitate the creation of unplanned tasks.

- **Sprint Goal Alignment:** If the development team identifies opportunities to enhance the sprint goal by adding new tasks or stories, they can discuss this with the Product Owner, and if approved, create additional tasks or issues.

## Definitions for Story and Tasks in the Issue Tracker:

**Issue Tracker Stories:**
- Goal: Represents a user's perspective on an issue to resolve.
- Scope: Outlines a project's vision, goals, and benefits.
- Duration: Completed when all tasks comprising the story are done, typically within a sprint.
- Delegation: Assigned to a project lead and may be divided into tasks.

**Issue Tracker Tasks / Subtasks:**
- Goal: Represents a step in the process.
- Scope: Individual piece of sprint or Scrum work.
- Duration: Completed in two days or less, intended to be finished within a sprint.
- Delegation: Assigned to a specific team member.
